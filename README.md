# AutoHotKeyScripts

A Set of AutoHotKeyScripts that I made to make my programming life easier.

### Why Use `Ctrl+Alt` and `Ctrl+Shift+Alt` with `Arrow Keys`?
Those key combinations as the hotkeys because I constantly use `Shift+Arrows` to select text, and `Ctrl` as a modifier to select words in the text. So I decided to expand on that functionality with `Alt` being the AutoHotKey trigger.

## List of Scripts
